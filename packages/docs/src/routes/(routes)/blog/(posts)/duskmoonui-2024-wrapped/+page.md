duskmoonUI started as a side project, a small collection of Tailwind CSS components. Now it's one of the first choices for many developers when they start a new project with Tailwind CSS. Thank you to everyone who used and contributed to duskmoonUI - this project wouldn't be possible without you üíö

## Official duskmoonUI Figma Library

It was a challenge for designers and developers to work together on a duskmoonUI project, without having access to the same design system.

There were many community attempts to create a Figma file for duskmoonUI, but none of them could fully cover all duskmoonUI components and features.

We know maintaining and updating a Figma library is a lot of work, so we decided to create an official Figma library for duskmoonUI. This is an official Figma library that is maintained by the duskmoonUI, and includes all components and all themes and all features, fully tokenized and ready to use in your projects.

Get the official duskmoonUI Figma Library from [duskmoonUI Store](/store/)

## New templates added

This year we released Nexus - a multi-page fully featured admin dashboard template, Documentation template, Blog template.
All made by duskmoonUI, available in [duskmoonUI Store](/store/).

## Accessibility improvements

We received lots of feedbacks and contributions to make the documentation more informative and to improve the accessibility of code examples. Notes and comments were added to the relevant sections to provide more context and to help you understand the examples better. Necessary aria attributes and roles were added to the relevant code examples to make them accessible for screen readers and keyboard navigation by default when you copy and paste them to your project.

## Keeping it compatible

No developer wants unexpected visual changes after a dependency update. In 2024, we prioritized stability by separating visual changes from functional bug fixes. Major visual updates were reserved for v5 (coming soon). In duskmoonUI 4 we also made sure older browsers would have fallback for new CSS features like OKLCH colors, until the majority of users have updated their browsers to the latest versions. This helped the incremental adoption of new CSS features in duskmoonUI.

## Discord server launch

The duskmoonUI Discord server was launched in 2024 to provide a place for the community to ask questions, share their projects, and get help from other developers. The server has grown to `3800` members. [Join us!](https://duskmoonui.com/discord/)

It's the result of more than 7 months of development, testing and feedback from the community, to make it easier to build beautiful interfaces with duskmoonUI.

duskmoonUI 5 is a huge update, fixing many bugs, and adding many new features, components, and themes. I'm excited about all the new CSS features and Tailwind CSS 4 features that we are using in duskmoonUI 5. I can't wait to share it with you all!
