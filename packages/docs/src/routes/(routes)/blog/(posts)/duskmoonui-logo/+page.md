Today we're having a brand refresh for duskmoonUI!

<div class="text-center">
  <img
    class="pointer-events-none inline-block align-bottom"
    src="https://img.duskmoonui.com/images/duskmoonui/mark-rotating.svg"
    alt="duskmoonUI logo"
    width="500"
    height="500"
    loading="lazy"
  />
</div>

The new logo moves away from the minimal geometric shapes and focuses on a more playful and friendly design. I've been picky about the logo for a long time, and I think this new design represents duskmoonUI in a more accurate way.

[Here you can get the files in PNG and SVG formats](/brand/). And if you're using duskmoonUI logo in your project, please consider using the new logo.

Join our [Discord](/discord/) to talk about the new logo and share your feedback. I would love to hear your thoughts!
